- Write as if the speaker is having an intimate conversation with close friends

- Include emotional pauses, natural hesitations, and conversational connectors
- NEVER use AI-sounding phrases like "In conclusion," "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally"
- Start with genuine, personal openings, not formal announcements
- Use specific, vivid details that paint pictures in listeners' minds
- Include genuine emotions and vulnerability when appropriate
- End with heartfelt, memorable moments, not summary statements
- Make every sentence sound like something a real person would actually say out loud
- Include natural speech patterns like "You know what I mean?" or "And here's the thing..."
- Use storytelling techniques with dialogue, sensory details, and emotional peaks`
